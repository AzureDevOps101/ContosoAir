# Demo Script

1. Integrate Azure Board with Github
2. Create a fork and create a Pull Request, in the pull request comment mention AB#<work item id>
3. Show the Work Item "Development" section is linked with the pull request
4. Make more commit and mention AB#<another work item id> to show the commit link
5. Merge Pull request with comment "fixed AB#<work item id>", make sure keep both Azure Board and Pull Request windows side by side so we can see the jump.

Done!
